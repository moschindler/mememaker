WELCOME to the help document. I'll try to keep this...helpful?
Some general tips:
-You can escape links with <>. So ?m pic <imgur.com/sex> ["hi"] will just make the meme and not send the pesky image preview with it.
-You can delete your message with -del. So ?m pic example ["hi"] -del will have Walter send the meme and then delete the message asking for its creation. Useful for...anonymity? I guess.
-For video memes, you can attach -gif in the same way to make it a gif.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the things I can do with Walter, anyway?

There are [n] basic formats which I'll describe in brief, then in detail.
pic,bpic -- your standard meme containing an image and a white bar above it. Think "when u nut but she keep on succin"
vid,bvid -- this currently isn't functional. Don't use it! If you really want to, nag me and I'll fix it...
btpic -- your standard "bottom text" meme...google "bottom text meme" if you really don't know what that is...
btvid -- the same thing, but with videos.
onpic -- an image but stuff on the image is labelled. uh...I don't really know how to describe it other than that.
onvid -- yeah, you wish this existed. Me too...
combine -- stitching together segments of youtube videos. has a pretty high rate of failure (maybe?) and takes walter foreverrrrrrrr...I suggest going in knowing what you want.
gridlines -- used to create onpic formats.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how do formats work?

RETRIEVING FORMATS.

It's as easy as ?f onpic list, ?f pic list, ?f video list
video gives you btvid formats, pic gives you pic/btpic, and onpic will send an imgur link with formats.
For ?f onpic list, the imgur images are: An image which contains some text on it of the form "1 (0.5)" "2 (0.8)" etc. The "1" represents that this is the first textbox you enter, the "2" represents it's the second, etc. The stuff in partentheses is the size, which you don't need to worry about unless you want to change it (see the OTHER link which pops up when you type ?f onpic list).


ADDING FORMATS.

For pics, it's as easy as ?f pic formatname url. For videos, it's ?f addvf formatname , and attach the video in your message.

For onpic it's more annoying, see the first link in ?f onpic list for help. See ?m shelp for quick access if you already know how to do it!

HOW DO I MAKE MY MEMES

?m pic

Simply do ?m pic formatname ["text you want","maybe on multiple lines"]. Replace formatname with an image link (with carats around it for no preview).
Do ?m bpic if you want the text on the bottom.

EXAMPLE: ?m pic cereal ["when you spit out","cereal"]
?m pic https://i.imgflip.com/ual56.jpg ["me: spits out cereal","nobody: woow"]
------------------------------------
?m btpic

Simply do ?m btpic formatname ["top text","multiple lines"] ["bottom text","blah"]. Replace formatname with an image link (with carats around for no preview) should you want.

Do ?m btpic random ["top text"] ["bottom text"] for a random image pulled from imgur, but be wary since like 5% of these are porn.
------------------------------------
?m btvid

Simply do ?m btvid formatname ["top text","multiple lines"] ["bottom text","blah"]
Add -gif at the end if you want it to send as a gif.
Youtube links aren't supported (in place of formatname) until ffmpeg 2 drops. Sorry!

See ?f video list for a list of available formats, although you'll have to guess what the format name actually represents (usually it's pretty clear)

See above section for how to add video formats.

EXAMPLE: ?m btvid fatguysdancing ["eyg convention"] ["eyg","convention"]
------------------------------------
?m onpic

See the first list in ?f onpic list for extensive help, but ...
Simply do
?m onpic formatname [["first text box","multiple lines"],["second text"],["third text..."]]
Note that this is an array of arrays, as opposed to a list of arrays. This is because the creator of Walter is an idiot.

For a list of formats, do ?f onpic help.

EXAMPLE: ?m onpic offering [["Me"],["Walter the bot"],["Cow","server"]]
------------------------------------
?gridlines. or is it ?m gridlines?

Used to create onpic formats. See the link in ?f onpic list.
------------------------------------
?combine

Used to create a video which is a concatenation of segments of YouTube videos.

?combine youtube_id_1 start_1 end_1 youtube_id_2 start_2 end_2 ... youtube_id_n start_n end_n

This could take a few minutes to compile, depending on how many clips you chose and how long the original video was!

I have no fucking clue what will happen if you try to do -gif on this, so don't... 

EXAMPLE: ?combine VRxGdlNVgCY 1 7.2 vlkhgr9pZ-A 37 50
I came up with that one myself! I think it's pretty funny.
