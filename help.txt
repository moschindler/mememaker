WELCOME to the help document. I'll try to keep this brief.
The first thing that I'll say is that you can escape links with <>.
So if you're tired of that Akshay nude preview appearing when you do ?m pic imgur.com/nude ["penis"],
you can do ?m pic <imgur.com/nude> ["penis"] and it'll fix that. Same with videos.

-----------------------------
The first general note I have is that you can attach "-del" to the end of any message and this bot will delete it for you.

PICTURE MEMES, that is, a white bar with text over a picture
SYNTAXES:
?m pic [link to picture] [text array]
?m pic [format name] [text array]
Note that the code automatically does linebreaks if the text is so long, so you only need a new
entry in the text array when you need a new line.
EXAMPLE: ?m pic cereal ["when you spit out", "cereal"]
?m pic https://i.imgflip.com/ual56.jpg ["me: spits out cereal","nobody: woow"]
-----------------------------
VIDEO MEMES, that is, a white bar with text over a video.
SYNTAXES:
?m video [youtube id or youtube link] [start second] [end second] [text array]
?m video [format name] [start second] [end second] [text array]
The start second and end second are the start and end of the youtube video clip.
EXAMPLE:
?m video dQw4w9WgXcQ 5 10 ["witty caption"]
?m video kakyoin 37 53 ["when akshay realizes people eat meat"]
-----------------------------
BPIC, BVID:
bpic and bvid are the same as pic and vid/video, except the text is now below the meme
EXAMPLE:
?m bpic cereal ["wooo now the text is below"]
-----------------------------
ONPIC:
Oh my god. This one was such a pain in the ass.
It's highly recommended to use ?m gridlines [pic url] first to help you know where shit goes.
Now you can put text on pictures! Like you see in most memes today.
SYNTAX:
?m onpic [pic url] [font/font array] [color/color array] [size/size array] [location array] [array of array of text]
?m onpic [format] [optional size array] [array of text arrays]

Actually, the six inputs in the first one can be sent in ANY ORDER!
You can remember this by: ...I don't know. Pretend I said a clever acronym here. 
Got it? Picture font size color location array of text.

EXAMPLE:
?m onpic blah.com/pic ["helvetica","arial"] red 0.5 [(20,50),(60,50)] [["me"],["my mom when she finds","the poop sock"]]
?m onpic monster2 [["Trump"],["Biden"],["Drake"]]
?m onpic monster2 [0.5,0.5,1.5] [["Trump"],["Biden"],["Drake"]]
In these last two examples, since the format "monster2" has already been created, you can either just provide the text array (and use the default sizes), or provide both a size array and a text array.

MORE EXPLANATION:

If only one input is given for any of font, color, size, it's assumed that's the input for ~all~ of them.
Each location corresponds to where a block of text goes. A location is given by the % x from the left and % y from the top.
So halfway across and all the way down is (50,100). Bottom right corner is (100,100).
Each sub-array of text is put at one location, and each thing in that array gets its own line.
With locations [(20,50),(60,80)] and text array array [["me"],["my mom when she finds","the poop sock"]],
"me" is centered at 20% across 50% down, and the two lines "my mom when she finds/the poop sock" are centered at 60% across 80% down.
HOW DO I KNOW WHERE GOOD PERCENTS ARE? OR FONT SIZES?
use ?m gridlines [pic url]

-------------------------------
GRIDLINES:
This is to help you with ONPIC. Shows gridlines at each 10% of width and height as well as what font sizes 1-0.1 look like.
SYNTAX:
?m gridlines [pic url]
-------------------------------
BOTTOM TEXT PIC:
Lets you put impact font text with borders on an image like you see in old and/or ironic memes.
SYNTAX:
?m [bt or btpic] [pic url or format] [array of text which will be the lines of top text] [array of text, bottom text]
-------------------------------
BOTTOM TEXT, BUT ON A RANDOM PIC:
This one seems to be popular!
Just ?m btpic random [array of text which will be lines of top text] [array of text, bottom text]
EXAMPLE:
?m btpic random ["bruh"] ["moment"]

Uh, no guarantees you'll get something SFW.
-------------------------------
BOTTOM TEXT VIDEO:
Like bottom text pic, but with a video!!!
SYNTAX:
?m [btvid or btvideo] [youtube id or format] [start time in s] [end time in s] [array of top text] [array of bottom text]
-------------------------------
combine uses a separate command 'cause it's an ass.
COMBINE: 
Literally just combine n video clips, possibly the same.
SYNTAX:
?combine [vid1 id] [start time 1] [end time 1] [vid2 id] ...
EXAMPLE:
?combine VRxGdlNVgCY 1 7.2 vlkhgr9pZ-A 37 50
?combine 3Y9fH-wexYc 3 8 r62U0dciMQM 5 10 3Y9fH-wexYc 60 68 r62U0dciMQM 15 20 3Y9fH-wexYc 101 105 r62U0dciMQM 25 30 3Y9fH-wexYc 172 180
